# Project Status and Workflow Analysis (v3)

## 1. Executive Summary

**UPDATE (August 2025):** This document tracks the significant transformation of the inv4mHighland genomics project from a collection of scattered analysis scripts into a well-organized R package. Recent development efforts have addressed many of the critical issues identified in the previous analysis (v2).

**Major Accomplishments (Recent Commits c4cbf22 - 8136283):**
- **Package Structure Implementation:** Successfully converted from scattered scripts to a proper R package with organized function libraries in `R/` directory
- **Code Consolidation:** Eliminated redundant files (`spatial_correlation_helpers.R`, `setup_package_dependencies.R`) and centralized functions into themed modules
- **Enhanced Spatial Analysis:** Added comprehensive spatial visualization functions with multi-trait support and improved variogram analysis
- **Dependency Management:** Proper package dependencies now handled through DESCRIPTION file
- **Function Documentation:** Complete roxygen2 documentation for all package functions

**Remaining Challenges:**
- **Legacy Script Integration:** Original analysis scripts in `scripts/` still contain hardcoded paths and duplicated logic
- **Data Pipeline Unification:** PSU 2022 workflows still operate independently from the new package structure
- **Path Portability:** Some hardcoded absolute paths remain in legacy scripts

**Current State:** The project now operates as a hybrid system with a modern R package core (`inv4mHighland`) alongside legacy analysis scripts. The package provides a solid foundation for spatial analysis workflows, particularly for the Clayton 2025 experiment data.

## 2. Package Structure Evolution

### 2.1. New R Package Organization

The project has undergone a major structural transformation into the `inv4mHighland` R package with the following organization:

**Core Function Modules:**
- `R/clayton_spatial_analysis.R` - Master workflow function `run_clayton_spatial_analysis()`
- `R/spatial_models.R` - Spatial correlation modeling functions (`fit_all_models()`, `extract_model_stats()`)
- `R/variogram_analysis.R` - Variogram calculation with multi-trait support (`calculate_scaled_variogram()`)
- `R/spatial_visualization.R` - Enhanced plotting functions (`show_spatial_distribution()`, `create_spatial_plot()`)
- `R/utils.R` - Utility functions for package management and validation
- `R/data_processing.R` - Data loading and cleaning functions

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Centralized Workflow:** `run_clayton_spatial_analysis()` provides a single entry point for complete spatial analysis
2. **Multi-trait Support:** Functions like `calculate_scaled_variogram()` and `show_spatial_distribution()` handle multiple phenotypes simultaneously
3. **Automatic Visualization:** New functions display traits in organized grids (3 per row, up to 9 default, 30 maximum)
4. **Error Handling:** Robust error checking and progress reporting throughout the pipeline
5. **Flexible Parameterization:** Functions accept custom labels, trait selections, and display options

### 2.2. Enhanced Notebook Interface

The `docs/notebooks/inv4m_field_modelling.Rmd` notebook has been dramatically simplified:
- **Before:** 50+ lines of repetitive code for spatial visualization
- **After:** 3 lines using `show_spatial_distribution(field_data, phenotypes)`

This demonstrates successful abstraction of complex analysis logic into reusable package functions.

## 3. Current Analytical Workflows

### 3.1. Modern Package-Based Workflow (Clayton 2025)

**STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - This workflow demonstrates the new package approach.

**Single-Function Workflow:**
```r
# Load package and run complete spatial analysis
library(inv4mHighland)
results <- run_clayton_spatial_analysis(
  data_file = "data/CLY25_Inv4m.csv",
  trait_names = c("PlantHeight_cm", "EarHeight_cm", "StalkDiameter_cm"),
  use_variogram = TRUE,
  create_plots = TRUE
)
```

**Internal Process Flow:**
1. **Data Loading:** `load_clayton_data()` with robust error handling
2. **Validation:** `validate_analysis_setup()` checks dependencies and data integrity  
3. **Variogram Analysis:** `calculate_scaled_variogram()` processes multiple traits simultaneously
4. **Spatial Modeling:** `fit_all_models()` tests correlation structures (corLin, corSpher, corGaus, corExp)
5. **Model Selection:** Automatic AIC-based selection of best spatial correlation model
6. **Visualization:** `show_spatial_distribution()` creates organized multi-trait plots
7. **Results Extraction:** Comprehensive output with model statistics and treatment effects

**Key Advantages:**
- Single function call replaces dozens of script lines
- Automatic error handling and progress reporting
- Consistent parameter validation across all sub-functions
- Flexible trait selection and visualization options

### 3.2. Legacy Workflows (PSU 2022) 

**STATUS: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL** - These maintain the original scattered script approach.

**PSU 2022 - Spatial Phenotype Analysis (Legacy)**
- **Script:** `scripts/psu_2022/spatial_modeling/analyze_psu_spatial_phenotypes.R`
- **Issues Remain:** Hardcoded paths, duplicated data processing logic
- **Functionality:** Still operational but not integrated with package functions

**PSU 2022 - RNA-seq Analysis (Legacy)**
- **FDR-based:** `scripts/psu_2022/expression/run_deg_linear_models.R` → `detect_rnaseq_fdr_degs.R`
- **mashr-based:** `scripts/psu_2022/expression/run_rnaseq_mashr_leaf_analysis.R`
- **Issues Remain:** Parallel methodologies without clear integration rationale

**PSU 2022 - Multi-omics Analysis (Legacy)**  
- **Ionomics:** `scripts/psu_2022/ionomics/` - Multiple scripts with duplicated data loading
- **Lipidomics:** `scripts/psu_2022/lipids/` - Independent processing pipelines
- **Issues Remain:** Significant code duplication, hardcoded paths

### 3.3. Hybrid Integration Opportunities

The package structure provides a foundation for integrating legacy workflows:

1. **Data Standardization:** Package data loading functions could replace scattered CSV reading logic
2. **Spatial Model Extension:** `fit_all_models()` could be adapted for PSU 2022 field layouts
3. **Visualization Unification:** `show_spatial_distribution()` could handle PSU phenotype data
4. **Pipeline Orchestration:** A `run_psu_spatial_analysis()` function could mirror the Clayton approach
